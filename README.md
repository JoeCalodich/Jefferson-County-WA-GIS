Shapefiles for Jefferson County Transit.
This repository will have shapefiles for Jefferson Transit, a transit agency serving Jefferson County, Washington. The shapefiles were created using QGIS 3.16.15 and data from the GTFS data base which can be found [here]([url](https://www.transitwiki.org/TransitWiki/index.php?title=Publicly-accessible_public_transportation_data)).
Currently only Jefferson Transit stops are availible, but I will update it periodically. 
I hope you enjoy, and find this useful!
